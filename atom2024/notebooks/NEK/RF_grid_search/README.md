# Running Grid Search for RF 
`RF_atomver.py` contains code for running the grid search 

`RF_gridsearch_allNEK.py`: does grid search for all datasets in a for loop (this can be broken down into separate py files, just ask us if that is better)
- Need to change file paths in this file to where NEK/ folder is (zip file in google https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uX_BhPlho6zpj8Atd3_crHUigkMM6tGC/view?usp=drive_link)


`testing_param_grid.csv` is a csv file of the different params we found in our grid searches so far and how we obtained the grid used for the search.
